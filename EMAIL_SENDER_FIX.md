# ‚úÖ Email Sender Issue - FIXED

## The Problem
Verification emails were showing "sent" but not actually being delivered.

### Root Cause
**Sender Email Mismatch**:
- **Configured**: `no-reply@reviewsandmarketing.com` ‚ùå
- **Verified in Postmark**: `subscriptions@reviewsandmarketing.com` ‚úÖ

Postmark requires the sender email (`EMAIL_FROM`) to match a verified sender signature. If they don't match, emails fail silently.

## The Fix

### Changed EMAIL_FROM in Vercel
**Before**: `no-reply@reviewsandmarketing.com`  
**After**: `subscriptions@reviewsandmarketing.com`

### Verified Sender in Postmark
```json
{
  "EmailAddress": "subscriptions@reviewsandmarketing.com",
  "Domain": "reviewsandmarketing.com",
  "Confirmed": true,
  "Name": "Mike Bobby"
}
```

## What Changed

**Subject**: Verification email subject  

### User Experience
- No visible change for users
- Emails now actually deliver
- "From" address is `subscriptions@` instead of `no-reply@`

---

## Why This Happened

### Postmark Verification Requirements
Postmark requires **ALL sender emails** to be verified:
1. **Individual Email**: Verify specific addresses (e.g., `subscriptions@domain.com`)
2. **Domain**: Verify entire domain with DNS records (e.g., `@reviewsandmarketing.com`)

### What Was Verified
- ‚úÖ `subscriptions@reviewsandmarketing.com` - Individual signature
- ‚ùå `no-reply@reviewsandmarketing.com` - Not verified
- ‚ùå `reviewsandmarketing.com` domain - Not fully verified

---

## Optional: Verify Full Domain

If you want to use **any email** from `@reviewsandmarketing.com` (like `no-reply@`, `support@`, etc.):

### Add Domain to Postmark
1. Go to https://account.postmarkapp.com
2. Click **Domains** ‚Üí **Add Domain**
3. Enter: `reviewsandmarketing.com`
4. Add DNS records to your DNS provider:
   - **DKIM** record (TXT)
   - **Return-Path** record (CNAME)
   - Verify **SPF** record exists

### DNS Records Example
```
Type: TXT
Name: 20161122._domainkey
Value: (Postmark provides this)

Type: CNAME  
Name: pm-bounces
Value: pm.mtasv.net
```

### After Domain Verified
You can change `EMAIL_FROM` to any address:
- `no-reply@reviewsandmarketing.com`
- `support@reviewsandmarketing.com`
- `hello@reviewsandmarketing.com`
