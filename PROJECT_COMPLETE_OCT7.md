## 💬 Tester Final Verdict

> "Everything related to the transactional emails now works exactly as intended... The reset email came from subscriptions@reviewsandmarketing.com and used the new template with a purple header, 'Return to Login' link and an explicit one-hour expiry/security note. There were no fallback plain-text emails—your multi-provider logic is working and Postmark is being used on the first try."

> "My recommendation: mark the email template work as complete (it meets all the requirements) and let real users test the Crisp chat and exit-intent popup in a normal browser to ensure they appear."
