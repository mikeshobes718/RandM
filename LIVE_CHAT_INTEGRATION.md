# Live Chat Widget Integration

## Current Implementation

**Status:** ✅ Crisp Chat is currently implemented and ready to use

The application includes a Crisp Chat widget integration (`src/components/CrispChat.tsx`) that provides real-time customer support.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Crisp Website ID

1. Sign up at https://crisp.chat
2. Create a website
3. Copy your Website ID from the Crisp dashboard

### 2. Configure Environment Variable

Add to your Vercel environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID=your-website-id-here
```

### 3. Add to Your Layout

The `CrispChat` component should be added to your root layout:

```tsx
import CrispChat from '@/components/CrispChat';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <CrispChat />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Features

### Automatic User Identification
- Automatically identifies logged-in users by email
- Extracts user data from Firebase auth token
- Sets custom session data

### Helper Functions
Use `CrispHelpers` to control the chat widget:

```typescript
import { CrispHelpers } from '@/components/CrispChat';

// Show/hide the widget
CrispHelpers.show();
CrispHelpers.hide();

// Open the chat window
CrispHelpers.open();

// Send a message
CrispHelpers.sendMessage('Hello!');

// Set user data
CrispHelpers.setUserEmail('user@example.com');
CrispHelpers.setUserName('John Doe');
```
