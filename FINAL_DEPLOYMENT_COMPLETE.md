## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Previous Deployment Failed:

1. **File Created Correctly:** ✅ `/api/auth/register/route.ts` existed in source
2. **Code Was Correct:** ✅ Proper Next.js API route structure
3. **Deployment Issue:** ❌ Build cache prevented new route from being included
4. **Solution:** Force rebuild without cache (`--force` flag)

### Lesson Learned:
When adding NEW API routes, always use `vercel --prod --force` to ensure they're included in the build.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For Existing Users:
Users created BEFORE this deployment were created with client-side Firebase and may have already received Firebase's auto-email. They won't be affected by this fix retroactively.

### For New Users:
All NEW registrations will use the server-side API and receive ONLY the branded Postmark email.

### Password Reset:
The `/forgot` page ALREADY uses our branded Postmark email (always has). The issue was only with verification emails during signup.
