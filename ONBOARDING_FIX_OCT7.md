# Onboarding Flow Fix - October 7, 2025

## 🐛 Bug Discovered

**Reported by**: Tester  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Core functionality affected

### Issue Description
New users were **skipping the entire onboarding flow** after email verification. Instead of being directed to `/onboarding/business` to connect their Google Places business, they were taken directly to `/dashboard`, leaving their business profile incomplete.

**Impact**: Users couldn't complete their business setup, meaning they couldn't:
- Add their Google Places ID
- Generate review links
- Create QR codes
- Access core app features

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
Two authentication pages had hardcoded redirects to `/dashboard`:

1. **`/verify-email` page** (3 locations):
   - Line 29: After auth state change detects verified email
   - Line 71: After clicking verification link from email
   - Line 157: After manually checking verification status

2. **`/login` page** (1 location):
   - Line 58: After successful login

All redirects went to `/dashboard` **without checking** if the user had completed onboarding.

### Why It Happened
The redirect logic was implemented before the onboarding flow was fully designed. When onboarding was added later, the redirect logic wasn't updated to check for business completion.

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Solution
Created intelligent redirect functions that check if a user has completed onboarding before deciding where to send them:

```typescript
async function getPostVerificationRedirect(): Promise<string> {
  try {
    // Check if user has a business record
    const response = await fetch('/api/businesses/me', {
      credentials: 'include',
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      // If user has a business, go to dashboard
      if (data && data.id) {
        return '/dashboard';
      }
    }

    // No business record found, need onboarding
    return '/onboarding/business';
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error checking onboarding status:', error);
    // Default to onboarding if we can't determine
    return '/onboarding/business';
  }
}
```

### What Changed

**Before**:
```typescript
// ❌ Always went to dashboard
window.location.href = '/dashboard';
```

**After**:
```typescript
// ✅ Checks if user needs onboarding first
const redirectUrl = await getPostVerificationRedirect();
window.location.href = redirectUrl;
```

### Files Modified
1. `/src/app/(auth)/verify-email/page.tsx` - 3 redirect locations updated
2. `/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - 1 redirect location updated

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: New User Registration
1. **Register** a new account at `/register`
2. **Verify email** via link in inbox
3. **Expected**: Redirected to `/onboarding/business` (business setup page)
4. **NOT expected**: Skip to `/dashboard`

### Test Case 2: New User Login (Before Onboarding)
1. **Register** new account and verify email
2. **Don't complete** business setup yet
3. **Logout** and **login** again
4. **Expected**: Redirected to `/onboarding/business` (resume onboarding)
5. **NOT expected**: Skip to `/dashboard`

### Test Case 3: Existing User Login (After Onboarding)
1. User who **already completed** business setup
2. **Login**
3. **Expected**: Redirected to `/dashboard` (normal behavior)

### Test Case 4: Manual Verification Check
1. Register new account
2. On verify-email page, click **"I've verified my email"** button
3. **Expected**: After verification, redirected to `/onboarding/business`

## 🎯 How It Works

### Decision Flow
```
User Completes Email Verification or Logs In
    ↓
Call getPostVerificationRedirect()
    ↓
Fetch /api/businesses/me (check for business record)
    ↓
    ├─ Has business record? → Redirect to /dashboard
    └─ No business record? → Redirect to /onboarding/business
```

### API Used
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/businesses/me`
- **Auth**: Session cookie (automatic)
- **Returns**: Business record if exists, 401/404 if not
- **Decision**: 
  - If `response.ok && data.id exists` → User has completed onboarding → Dashboard
  - Otherwise → User needs onboarding → Business setup

## 🔄 User Flow (Now Correct)

### New User Journey
```
1. Visit /register
   ↓
2. Fill form & submit
   ↓
3. Receive branded verification email (Postmark)
   ↓
4. Click verification link in email
   ↓
5. Redirect to /onboarding/business ✅
   ↓
6. Search for Google Places business
   ↓
7. Select business & save
   ↓
8. Redirect to /dashboard
   ↓
9. See dashboard with business data
```

### Returning User Journey
```
1. Visit /login
   ↓
2. Enter credentials
   ↓
3. Check: Has business? 
   ├─ Yes → /dashboard
   └─ No → /onboarding/business
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check If Working
Query Supabase `businesses` table after new user registration:

```sql
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.owner_uid,
  b.name,
  b.google_place_id,
  b.created_at
FROM businesses b
WHERE b.owner_uid = 'USER_UID_HERE'
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;
```

**Expected**: New users should have a business record after completing onboarding.

### Logs to Watch
Search Vercel logs for:
- `Error checking onboarding status` - API failures
- Business API 401/404 responses
- Unexpected `/dashboard` access by new users

---

## 💡 Prevention

To prevent this in the future:

### 1. **Centralized Redirect Logic**
Consider creating a shared utility:
```typescript
// src/lib/redirects.ts
export async function getAuthenticatedRedirect(user: User): Promise<string> {
  // Check onboarding
  // Check email verification
  // Check subscription status
  // Return appropriate URL
}
```

### 2. **Middleware Check**
Add middleware to catch incomplete profiles:
```typescript
// middleware.ts
if (path === '/dashboard' && !await hasCompletedOnboarding()) {
  return redirect('/onboarding/business');
}
```

### 3. **Database Constraint**
Add a `onboarding_completed` flag to users table for explicit tracking.
