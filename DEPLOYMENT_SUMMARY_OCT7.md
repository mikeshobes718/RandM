# Deployment Summary - October 7, 2025

## What Was Completed

### ‚úÖ 1. Newsletter Popup Bug - FIXED
**Issue**: Newsletter signup popup reappeared even after users successfully subscribed.

**Root Cause**: Cookie check only happened once on component mount. If user subscribed and triggered exit intent again on the same page, popup would reopen.

**Fix**: Now checks cookie every time before opening popup, not just on mount.

**File Changed**: `src/components/ExitIntentPopup.tsx`

**Test Steps**:
1. Visit homepage
2. Trigger exit intent (move mouse to top of browser)
3. Subscribe to newsletter
4. Close popup
5. Trigger exit intent again
6. ‚úÖ Popup should NOT reappear
