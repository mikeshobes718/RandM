# Deployment Status

## Current Issue: 502 Bad Gateway

Tester reported 502 errors after latest deployment. This typically indicates:

2. Clear any cached build artifacts
3. Reinitialize serverless functions

## Expected Result

After this deployment completes:
- ✅ Site loads without 502 errors
- ✅ Password reset emails use branded Postmark template
- ✅ Verification emails show all enhancements (benefits list, security note)
