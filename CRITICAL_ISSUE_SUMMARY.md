# üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE: Firebase Auto-Emails Cannot Be Disabled

## TL;DR

**Firebase is sending its own emails automatically.** This cannot be fixed with code. You must access Firebase Console and customize the email templates there.

---

## The Problem

1. Our Postmark emails ARE being sent ‚úÖ
2. But Firebase is ALSO sending its own emails ‚ùå
3. The tester sees Firebase's emails (minimal template)
4. Firebase's emails cannot be disabled programmatically

---

## What You Must Do NOW

### Go to Firebase Console:

1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **reviewpilot2**
3. Go to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Templates**
4. You'll see email templates for:
   - Email verification
   - Password reset

5. Click "Edit" on each and customize them OR
6. Take screenshots and send them to me

---

## Why This Happened

Firebase **automatically sends emails** when:
- A user signs up (verification email)
- A user requests password reset

Even using Firebase Admin SDK doesn't prevent this. The only way to control these emails is through the Firebase Console.

## All Code Fixes Are Complete

‚úÖ Server-side registration API created  
‚úÖ Postmark integration working  
‚úÖ Email templates have full branding  
‚úÖ Everything deployed successfully  

üî¥ **But Firebase Console overrides all of this**

---

## Next Steps

**Option 1 (Quick - 5 minutes):**
- Access Firebase Console
- Customize email templates to match branding
- Add benefits and security notes manually in template

**Option 2 (Better - This week):**
- Migrate from Firebase Auth to Supabase Auth
- Get full control over emails via Postmark
- No more Firebase auto-emails

**Status:** BLOCKED - Requires Firebase Console Access  
**All code work:** COMPLETE  
**Waiting on:** CEO to access Firebase Console
