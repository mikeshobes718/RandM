## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Verify Sender Domain in Postmark

Before testing, you need to ensure `no-reply@reviewsandmarketing.com` is verified in Postmark.

### Quick Check:
1. Go to https://account.postmarkapp.com
2. Click **Sender Signatures** or **Domains**
3. Look for `reviewsandmarketing.com`

### If NOT Verified:
You need to add DNS records for your domain:

1. In Postmark → **Domains** → **Add Domain**
2. Enter: `reviewsandmarketing.com`
3. Copy the DNS records (DKIM, Return-Path)
4. Add them to your DNS provider (likely Vercel or GoDaddy/Namecheap)
5. Wait for verification (usually a few minutes)

### If Already Verified:
✅ You're all set! Test registration now.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting "Server token" Error?

**Check 1: Postmark Sender Verification**
- Most common issue: sender domain not verified
- Solution: Add DNS records in Postmark dashboard

**Check 2: Token is Correct**
```bash
vercel env ls | grep POSTMARK
```
Should show POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN for all environments

**Check 3: Check Postmark Activity**
1. Go to https://account.postmarkapp.com
2. Click **Activity** → **Outbound**
3. Look for recent sends
4. Check for errors

### Getting "Invalid Sender" Error?

The EMAIL_FROM address needs to be verified. Options:

**Option 1: Use a verified sender signature**
Add just the email address in Postmark → Sender Signatures

**Option 2: Verify entire domain**
Add DNS records for `reviewsandmarketing.com`

**Option 3: Use Postmark's test address**
Change EMAIL_FROM in Vercel to a verified address like:
```
EMAIL_FROM=youremail@yourdomain.com
```
