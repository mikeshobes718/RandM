## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
The `EMAIL_FROM` environment variable in Vercel contained a literal `\n` newline character at the end, causing Zod email validation to fail.

**Before:** `subscriptions@reviewsandmarketing.com\n` ❌  
**After:** `subscriptions@reviewsandmarketing.com` ✅

### Actions Taken

1. **Updated Local Environment**
   - Changed `.env.local` from `no-reply@reviewsandmarketing.com` to `subscriptions@reviewsandmarketing.com`

2. **Fixed Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Removed `EMAIL_FROM` with newline character
   - Re-added `EMAIL_FROM` without newline using `printf` instead of `echo`
   - Applied fix to **all environments**: Production, Preview, Development

3. **Redeployed to Vercel**
   - Fresh deployment with corrected environment variables
   - Build completed successfully in ~1 minute
   - Deployment URL: `https://reviewsandmarketing-m5qpld10u-mikes-projects-9cbe43e2.vercel.app`

4. **Tested Both Email Templates**
   - Sent test verification email ✅
   - Sent test password reset email ✅

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Use `printf` instead of `echo`** when piping values to `vercel env add` to avoid newline issues
2. **Pull and inspect env vars** with `vercel env pull` to debug validation issues
3. **Test email content** with dedicated scripts before manual testing
4. **Environment variable format matters** - even invisible characters can cause validation failures
